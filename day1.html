        	<p>Day One of the Texas MS150 begins at Addicks Park and Ride in Houston’s Energy Corridor, where thousands of riders gather in the cool early morning air. The official start time is 6:45 AM, and the atmosphere is filled with excitement and anticipation as cyclists prepare for the challenge ahead. The first miles move through wide suburban roads before gradually giving way to the open spaces of Southeast Texas. Early sunlight stretches across farmland and prairie, creating a striking backdrop as the crowd of riders settles into their pace and begins the long journey west. The sense of energy is contagious, with cheers from volunteers and the buzz of wheels signaling the start of an unforgettable day.</p>
			<p>The ride continues steadily toward La Grange, with the finish line waiting at the Fayette County Fairgrounds. After nearly 100 miles of pedaling, cyclists crest the final hills and enter oak-lined stretches of roadway before descending into the Colorado River Valley. This approach to La Grange is one of the most memorable scenes of the entire weekend, combining natural beauty with the thrill of nearing the end of a long ride. At the fairgrounds, the reward is immediate: cheering crowds, food and music, showers, and space to rest and recover. The grounds become more than just a stopping point as they transform into a celebration of teamwork, accomplishment, and shared purpose as riders, volunteers, and supporters come together.</p>
			<p>Along the route, cyclists encounter the unique charm of small-town Texas that gives the MS150 its distinctive character. Rest stops in Katy, Industry, and Fayetteville offer not only water, snacks, and mechanical support but also a warm welcome from local communities. A highlight of Day One is the lunch stop in Bellville at the Austin County Fairgrounds, where riders can pause under shade trees, enjoy a meal, and recharge for the miles ahead. Between these stops, the route winds through ranchland, rolling pastures, and fields of wildflowers that bloom in the spring, making the ride as visually rewarding as it is physically demanding. Every turn of the pedals is supported by a landscape and community that remind participants why this event is both a challenge and a celebration.</p>
