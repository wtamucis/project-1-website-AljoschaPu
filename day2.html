        	<p>Day Two begins in the early morning as riders depart from La Grange, shaking off the miles from the first day and setting out under the rising sun. The cool morning air and quiet country roads provide a fresh start, with cyclists pedaling out of the Colorado River Valley and into the heart of Central Texas. The energy at the start is both determined and celebratory, as teams regroup and set their sights on the final push to College Station.</p>
			<p>The route quickly unfolds into rolling hills and wide open ranchland, offering both challenge and beauty. Riders weave past fields and rural communities before arriving at the lunch stop on the shores of Lake Somerville, a welcome midway break surrounded by sparkling water and scenic vistas. Here, participants recharge with food and rest while enjoying the natural beauty of one of Texasâ€™s most beloved recreation spots.</p>
			<p>From Lake Somerville, the final stretch carries cyclists north toward College Station. The anticipation builds with each passing mile as riders approach the Texas A&M campus. The day culminates in a grand finish at Kyle Field, where thousands of family members, friends, and volunteers gather for a festival-like celebration. Music, food, and the roar of the crowd make the finish line an unforgettable experience, marking not just the end of a 150-mile journey but a powerful show of unity in the fight against multiple sclerosis.</p>
